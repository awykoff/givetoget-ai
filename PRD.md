# Product Requirements Document — givetoget.ai

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** April 26, 2026  
**Status:** Active — v1 MVP  
**Owner:** Aaron Wykoff / A. Wykoff Consulting  

---

## 1. Problem Statement

B2B sales and marketing teams pay $100–$50,000/year for contact databases (Apollo, ZoomInfo, Lusha) that are scraped, stale, and increasingly inaccurate. Meanwhile, every one of those teams already has a contact list sitting in their CRM — leads they've worked, accounts they've prospected, events they've attended — that they're not monetizing.

There is no platform that lets teams trade the data they have for the data they need.

---

## 2. Solution

**givetoget.ai** is a B2B contact database exchange. Upload your contact list, earn credits for every unique new contact you contribute to the shared pool, and spend credits to download contacts filtered by vertical, seniority, location, and company size.

The more teams contribute, the more valuable the database becomes for everyone.

**Tagline:** Give contacts. Get contacts.

---

## 3. Target Users

### Primary ICP
- **Role:** Sales Ops, RevOps, Growth, SDR Manager
- **Company:** B2B SaaS startup, Series A–C, 20–500 employees
- **Pain:** High cost of Apollo/ZoomInfo; has orphaned contact lists; needs vertical-specific data
- **Geography:** United States (primary)

### Secondary ICP
- Marketing agencies and lead gen firms with large contact archives
- Demand gen managers who need fresh data on specific verticals

### Not a Fit
- B2C companies
- Enterprises with locked-in ZoomInfo annual contracts
- Teams without any existing contact data to contribute

---

## 4. Core Credit Loop

```
User uploads CSV
  → System validates emails, rejects personal domains
  → Deduplicates against global contacts table (email = dedup key)
  → +1 credit per unique new contact inserted
  → Credits added to workspace ledger

User browses global database
  → Filters by vertical, seniority, location, company size
  → Selects contacts (email gated until export)
  → -1 credit per contact downloaded
  → Export file generated (CSV / XLSX / JSON)
```

Credits never expire. The ledger is append-only.

## 7. Technical Architecture

### Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Auth | Supabase Auth (email + Google OAuth) |
| Database | Supabase (Postgres 15) with RLS |
| Storage | Supabase Storage (CSV uploads, export files) |
| Edge Functions | Supabase Edge Functions (Deno) |
| Hosting | Vercel |
| Font | DM Sans (Google Fonts) |

### Key Database Tables
`workspaces` · `workspace_members` · `contacts` · `imports` · `exports` · `export_contacts` · `credits_ledger` · `workspace_contact_access`

### Critical Rules
- Credits ledger: **append-only** — never UPDATE or DELETE
- Email dedup key: `email_normalized` (LOWER + TRIM, generated column)
- Contact email: never returned in frontend queries without credit unlock
- RLS: enabled on all tables from day one

### Design System
- Background: `#0C0C0F` · Cards: `#18181D` · Sidebar: `#111115`
- Accent: `#8B5CF6` (violet) · Accent text: `#C4B5FD`
- Font: DM Sans · Borders: `rgba(255,255,255,0.07)` ghost
- Aesthetic: Attio dark mode — flat, enterprise SaaS, no shadows

## 12. Open Questions

- [ ] Should contributors see which workspace contributed a contact? (privacy vs. trust)
- [ ] What is the dispute resolution path if a user claims credits weren't awarded correctly?
- [ ] Should there be a minimum contribution quality bar before credits are awarded (e.g., must have `company` field)?
- [ ] How do we handle GDPR / CCPA for EU/CA contacts in the pool?
- [ ] At what pool size does the product become self-sustaining (cold start threshold)?
